# listy
A list App that just works. No gimmicks, just lists inside lists inside lists inside ... you get the point. 

Listy takes advantage of a tree structure to organize lists into sublists in a way that is easy to understand. Gone are the days of adding notes or other 
meta data to a list. Need more info than just the title of the item in the list? tap on it to make another sublist. Having infinite sublists lets you take 
control of the things you need to keep track of by orginizing them in a way that is intuitive and elegant.
